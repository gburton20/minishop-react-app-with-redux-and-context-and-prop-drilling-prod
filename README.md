# MiniShop React App with Redux, Context, and Prop Drilling (Production)

This is the production repository for `minishop-react-app-with-redux-and-context-and-prop-drilling`. The app is a full-stack Django/React web application designed to demonstrate three state management patterns in a single-page React application: **Redux**, **Context API**, and **prop drilling**.

---

## Project Overview

MiniShop is a learning-focused e-commerce demo platform featuring product browsing, a shopping cart, and authentication. The frontend is built in React (using Vite) and the backend is powered by Django REST Framework, with Auth0 used for authentication.

This application showcases how to manage state in React using **Redux**, **Context API**, and **prop drilling**, with practical examples comparing their trade-offs and usage.

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React (latest) with Vite
- Redux Toolkit (global state management)
- React Context API (global state management)
- Prop Drilling (direct prop passing)
- React Router DOM (routing)
- Auth0 React SDK (authentication)
- ESLint (linting)

**Backend:**
- Django 4.2+ (web framework)
- Django REST Framework (API)
- django-cors-headers (CORS)
- Pillow (image upload)
- SQLite (default DB; PostgreSQL supported)
- Auth0 JWT integration

**Other:**
- PostgreSQL support (via `psycopg2-binary`)
- Python Jose (JWT handling)

---

## Features

- Product browsing and filtering
- Shopping cart with real-time updates (via Redux, context, and prop drilling)
- Auth0-powered login/logout and user profiles
- Product management for authenticated users
- Image upload for products
- Responsive/mobile-friendly design
- Cart persistence (local storage)
- API pagination for efficient data loading
- Real-time cart icon counter in navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js 16+** and **npm**
- **Git**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gburton20/minishop-react-app-with-redux-and-context-and-prop-drilling-prod.git
cd minishop-react-app-with-redux-and-context-and-prop-drilling-prod
```

### Backend Setup (Django)

```bash
cd backend/minishop_backend_project_directory
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser  # Optional
python manage.py runserver
```
Backend API is available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173/`.

> **Note:** Keep both servers running for the complete app functionality.

---

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/products/` — Retrieve products (paginated)
- `POST /api/products/` — Add product (auth required)
- `GET /api/profile/` — Get user profile data

**CORS:** Backend allows requests from React dev server by default.

**Authentication:**  
1. Auth0 login via React frontend  
2. JWT token sent to Django API  
3. Protected endpoints require valid Auth0 JWT  
4. Product/user data extracted from token

## Common Commands

| Action                 | Backend Command                   | Frontend Command |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Install dependencies   | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `npm install`    |
| Run dev server         | `python manage.py runserver`      | `npm run dev`    |
| Run tests              | `python manage.py test`           | `npm test`       |

## Environment Configuration

### Backend (`settings.py`)
- `DEBUG`: True for development
- `SECRET_KEY`: Change for production
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Set for deployment
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Add frontend dev URL

### Frontend (Auth0 in `src/main.jsx`)
```jsx
<Auth0Provider
  domain="your-auth0-domain"
  clientId="your-auth0-client-id"
  authorizationParams={{
    redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
    audience: "your-auth0-api-audience",
    scope: "openid profile email read:current_user update:current_user_metadata"
  }}
>
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**CORS:**  
- Ensure `django-cors-headers` is installed and configured  
- Check frontend URL in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

**Authentication:**  
- Confirm Auth0 domain/client ID in frontend  
- Use SPA settings in Auth0 dashboard  
- API audience must match Auth0 config

**Database:**  
- Run `python manage.py migrate` for DB setup  
- Delete `db.sqlite3` and re-run migrations for a reset

**Image Upload:**  
- Install `Pillow`  
- Check `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` in settings

**Ports:**  
- Backend: 8000, Frontend: 5173 (default)  
- Change ports if needed

## State Management Demo: Redux, Context, and Prop Drilling

This app demonstrates three approaches:
- **Redux Toolkit:** Application-wide state management with reducers, actions, and slices for cart, auth, and more.
- **Context API:** Using React context for globally needed state (cart, auth) with provider and consumer patterns.
- **Prop Drilling:** Passing cart, auth, and handlers directly through component tree layers (e.g., `App.jsx` → `Home.jsx` → `ProductCardsList.jsx` → `ProductCard.jsx`).

Comparative code samples illustrate when to use Redux, context, or prop drilling, and discuss trade-offs in scalability, maintainability, and performance.
